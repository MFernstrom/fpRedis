# fpc-redis-client
This is a redis client library for [Freepascal](https://freepascal.org/) / [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus-ide.org/)

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is a fast in-memory nosql database

It is a continuation of an older implementation https://github.com/ik5/redis_client.fpc (At the time of writing the last update was 6 years ago)

I'm updating, bugfixing, and adding features.

**TODO**

* Implement more commands

**Compatibility**

I'm testing this as I go with

* Lazarus 1.6.4
* FPC 3.0.2
* i386-darwin-carbon
* Redis 4.0.1 (Latest at the time of writing)

Once I have a release-candidate I'll test with Linux and Windows as well.

**License**

The original code was released under a modified LGPL to allow linking without releasing code, this version has the same licensing as the original.
